# Phaser Sandbox

TL;DR jsfiddle for phaser

### [TRY IT!](http://phaser-sandbox.herokuapp.com/)

This is an online sandbox/editor made for testing and sharing code snippets. It's designed specifically for phaser and can be used to demonstrate bugs with various versions.

## How to use

Either add to the default code, or copy and paste a snippet from http://examples.phaser.io

I have included all assets available to the examples, but at this stage you will not be able to add your own.

## Contribute!

If you find any bugs, please open a github issue or pull request with a fix :)

## TODO

- Keyboard shortcut to run new code
- Show library of basic assets available to use
- Selectable phaser version (same as examples.phaser.io)
- Persist code snippets with linkable URLs to share on github and forums
- Make it look sexy and respectable like all the other phaser sites
